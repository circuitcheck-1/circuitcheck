# CircuitCheck ⚡

CircuitCheck is a schematic-level PCB design analysis web application that
detects common hardware design mistakes **before fabrication**.

It helps reduce first-board failures by automatically analyzing schematic
netlists and reporting potential design risks with clear recommendations.
